# FitLit

## Abstract

This is the pair project from Mod 2 at the Turing School for Software and Design. The goal was to create an activity-tracking app using provided data sets. Other learning goals included implementing a robust testing suite, implementing ES6 classes, and using object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation. The project specification can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/fitlit.html).
